üìå Week 6 Recap at Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative - DEPI | Penetration Testing Track

This week, I focused on creating two detailed reports that solidified my understanding of penetration testing and ethical hacking practices:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Penetration Testing Report for Banking Systems:

Covered the scope, including public-facing systems, internal systems, and physical security.
Explored engagement phases such as planning, execution (reconnaissance, initial access, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration), and reporting.
Identified potential attack vectors to assess vulnerabilities while ensuring ethical compliance.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Ethical Hacking Guidelines & Professional Standards Report:

Defined the purpose, scope, and authorized activities for ethical hacking.
Highlighted confidentiality obligations, including NDA requirements and data protection measures.
Emphasized compliance with legal standards like GDPR and frameworks like EC-Council‚Äôs principles.
This week enriched my knowledge of structured testing methodologies and reinforced the importance of ethical and professional standards in cybersecurity. Excited to keep building on this journey! üöÄ
